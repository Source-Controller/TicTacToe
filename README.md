# Tic Tac Toe


[Tic Tac Toe](https://tic-tac-toe-playing.vercel.app/) game, a classic game for two players where each player takes turns marking a grid of 3x3 squares with their X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. It is also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os. The game is implemented using React and CSS

## Game rules

1. The game is played on a grid that is 3 squares by 3 squares
2. You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over
